Spanda
  is Invibragen’s proprietary vibrating sharp-
edge spray ionization (VSSI) technology, designed to 
enhance ionization efficiency while supporting high -
throughput, multimodal mass spectrometry 
workflows. The platform enables broad applicability 
across analytes, matrices, and experimental designs.
Invibragen partners with research labs across academia, biotechnology, 
pharmaceutical R&D, and government to deliver high-throughput molecular analysis 
at scale. Using its proprietary Spanda
  technology, Invibragen supports faster , more 
efficient analysis of blood and other biological samples. As a result, research teams 
can process dramatically more samples, reduce cost per result, and unlock 
discovery that is difficult or impractical with conventional workflows. Services are 
designed to integrate seamlessly with existing lab infrastructure, enabling 
immediate impact without added complexity.
