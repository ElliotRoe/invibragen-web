High-Throughput Without Data Quality Trade-offs
Conventional workflows force a choice between speed and sensitivity. 
Invibragen breaks that trade-off.
High Data Quality
(Stable, Reproducible Signals)
Low Data Quality
(Frequent Signal Loss/Variability)
Low Throughput
(10-50 Samples per 
Instrument)
INVIBRAGENConventional ESI 
(Nano-flow)
High Throughput
(1-5K Samples per 
Instrument)
Conventional ESI 
(Micro-flow)
Other Spray-Based
