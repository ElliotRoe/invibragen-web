INVIBRAGEN 
Marketing Creative Brief 
Jan 2026  
 
Purpose 
This brief defines the core messaging, visual and emotional direction  for Invibragen’s marketing. The goal 
is to align the brand’s look and feel with Invibragen’s scientific rigor, credibility, and trustworthines s. 
 
Background 
Invibragen delivers unprecedented throughput in molecular analysis, enabling labs to process 
dramatically more samples with greater speed and efficiency  - lowering costs and opening the door to 
entirely new discovery possibilities. This positions Invibragen not simply as a faster service, but as a new 
kind of discovery engine.  
 
Working with complex biological samples where precision and control are essential, Invibragen 
separates true biological signals from noise  through faster, more sensitive, and more comprehensive 
measurement – ultimately unlocking deeper biological insight.  
 
Target Customers 
Academic, Biotech and industrial research labs  (see Appendix). 
 
Primary Messaging Principle: Outcomes  Over Features 
While Invibragen’s technology is highly advanced, the primary role of its marketing is to help researchers 
quickly understand its relevance and value. A common mistake in scientific communication is focusing 
solely on product features, rather than the researcher’s real -world challenges. Invibragen avoids this 
pitfall by meeting researchers where they are  - acknowledging constraints such as time pressure, limited 
budgets, and the need for clear, interpretable  results.  
 
Core Creative Concept 
Move Faster. Spend Less. Discover More.  
Invibragen represents clean, cutting -edge intelligence  - a modern scientific platform that helps labs move 
faster, make better use of existing resources, and scale discovery beyond what traditional workflows 
allow. 
• From a copy perspective , this means leading with outcomes researchers care about : faster 
turnaround, fewer re -runs, lower cost per result, and clearer biological signal  - rather than 
technical features alone.  
• From a design perspective , this means reducing visual and conceptual noise, prioritizing clarity, 
and presenting complex science in a way that is immediately interpretable and trustworthy.  
 
Brand Personality (How Invibragen should sound and feel) 
• Intelligent and precise  
• Calm and controlled  
• Scientifically rigorous  
• Transparent and evidence -led

• Modern but grounded  
• Human-guided  
 
What Invibragen Is Not: 
• Not edgy or hype -driven startup tech  
• Not dark, mysterious, or black -box  
• Not emotional or story -first  (lifestyle)  
 
Visual Brand Summary  
Invibragen’s visual identity is built to reduce noise and increase clarity.  Every design decision 
should reinforce precision, interpretability, and trust.  If a design feels busy, colorful, or dramatic, it is likely 
off-brand. 
 
Color Rules 
• Light-first design: White space is intentional and essential  
• Restrained color use:  Color guides attention ; Nothing rushed, flashy, or overstated  
 
Guides 
• Off-White (# F2F2F2): Primary  canvas 
• Light Gray (#FFFFFF): Structure and separation  
• Calm Teal (#5EBABA): Brand signal and emphasis  
• Light Mint (#D8FFDC): Subtle support  
• Charcoal (#7F8183): Readable, academic text  
 
Typography 
Typography should feel confident and composed, not trendy or playful.  
• Headlines: Editorial or academic -feeling serif (signals credibility and seriousness)  
• Body copy: Clean, modern sans -serif (clarity and readability)  
 
Layout & Structure 
The layout should feel intentional and breathable, reflecting precision and control.  
• Generous white space  
• Clear hierarchy and pacing  
• Minimal clutter  
• Information presented in a calm, digestible way  
Imagery & Visuals  
• Data or diagrams used selectively and clearly  
• Abstract scientific visuals (flows, gradients, fields, particles)

• Clean instrument or technology details (minimal backgrounds)  
 
Avoid:  
• Stock photos ; Overly literal or cliché biotech imagery ; Emotional storytelling

Marketing Asset Goals  
• Website: The website is our central source of truth - establishing credibility, telling 
Invibragen’s full story, and converting interest into conversations. This is where serious 
prospects go to evaluate credibility and fit. It should: 
o Explain our value prop in depth 
o Establish scientific legitimacy 
▪ Provide proof points, handle skepticism 
▪ House detailed use cases, published papers, etc. 
▪ Introduce the team 
o Convert interest into discussions: 
▪ Start a conversation / request a pilot / contact us  
o Be discoverable! (SEO) 
 
• Pamphlet: The pamphlet is not meant to explain everything - it is meant to spark interest, 
orient the reader, and prompt action/follow-up. It should: 
o Communicate what Invibragen does 
o Reinforce key differentiators 
o Be highly scannable and visual 
o Be memorable 
o Make it easy to follow up 
o Drive traffic to the website or direct outreach

Target Customers 
• Near-Term: Academic Labs: Academic labs represent the best first customers for Invibragen’s 
services and should be the primary audience for the initial website, pamphlet, and outreach. This 
group enables Invibragen to build proof, reputation, and scientific legitimacy quickly.  
o Open to novel technologies  
o Strong fit with discovery -based workflows 
o Willing to pilot and validate  
o Generate publications, credibility, and references  
o Lower procurement friction  
o Operating under tight research budgets  
 
• Mid-Term: Industrial & Pharmaceutical Research Labs: Once academic validation is 
established, outreach can expand to labs which bring larger budgets, higher volume potential, 
and longer sales cycles.  
o Biotech labs: Genentech, Amgen, Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Regeneron, Biogen, 
Moderna 
o Pharma R&D: Merck, Lilly, Pfizer, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Bristol -
Myers Squibb 
o Clinical CRO’s: (Contract Research Organizations): Eurofins, IQVIA, ICON, Charles River 
Laboratories, Syneos Health, WuXi Apptec, BioAgilytix, Labcorp  
o Government and Forensic Labs : FBI, crime labs, public health agencies  
 
• Longer-Term:  
o Instrumentation Companies: While instrumentation companies would mainly be 
interested in the Spanda platform itself, they may initially engage through services to 
validate the technology, assess market traction, and reduce acquisition or integration risk.
