HOMEPAGE 
 
Move Faster. Spend Less. Discover More. 
Invibragen partners with research labs to overcome the traditional trade-offs between speed, 
cost, and data quality. By making large-scale molecular analysis practical and reliable, 
Invibragen enables labs to unlock new biological insight at a scale that was previously 
impractical or impossible. 
 
PILLARS 
 
1. Move Faster with Ultra High-Throughput Analysis 
Invibragen delivers dramatically higher sample throughput without sacrificing data quality. 
 
This includes: 
• Speed: Up to 10x faster turnaround time from sample to insight 
• Sensitivity & Fidelity: Maintains sensitivity at high speed—and in many cases detects 
more signals by capturing a broader molecular range 
• Flexibility: Applicable across blood, saliva, and other matrices 
 
2. Lower Cost per Result 
Higher throughput directly improves lab economics: 
• Greater output from existing infrastructure, increasing the value of current instruments 
and teams 
• Fewer re-runs and failed analyses, reducing wasted time, samples, and reagents 
• Lower cost per meaningful result, driven by higher utilization and more efficient 
workflows 
 
3. Discover More at Scale 
In traditional workflows, researchers studying treatment response are often limited to small 
cohorts and a narrow set of measured molecules, making it difficult to separate true biological 
signals from noise. By working with Invibragen, research teams can analyze orders of 
magnitude more samples across thousands of proteins or metabolites - in a fraction of the time 
and cost of traditional workflows. The result is greater statistical confidence and more reliable 
population-level discovery, delivered with speed and efficiency.
